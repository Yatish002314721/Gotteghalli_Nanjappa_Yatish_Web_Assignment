Project Overview
The project demonstrates the use of Sass to structure and manage CSS efficiently while using Flexbox for layout components like the header and footer, and CSS Grid for the main content sections.

Features
Responsive Layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
Sass for modular and maintainable CSS.
Variables for easy theme management (e.g., colors, fonts).
Mixins for reusable CSS code blocks (e.g., media queries, Flexbox alignment).
Nesting for cleaner and more readable styles.
Installation
Prerequisites
